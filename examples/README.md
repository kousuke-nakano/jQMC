# Examples

A collection of examples of jQMC codes.

## example01

Total energy of water molecule with the Jastrow-Slater anstaz. One can learn how to obtain the VMC and DMC (in the extrapolated limit) energies of the water molecule, starting from scratch (i.e., DFT calculation by pySCF), with cartesian GTOs.

## example02

Benchmarking of MPI/Vectorization on CPU and GPU machines, i.e., how to choose the most efficient number of walkers and number of MPI processes.

## example03

Binding energy of water-methane dimer, one of the validation tests for ab initio DMC implementation.

## example04

VMC and HF energies of water molecule, for validation of the VMC implementation of jQMC, with spherical or cartesian GTOs.

## example05

Potential energy surface of hydrogen molecule with cartesian GTOs. All electron calculations. Comparison atomic forces with the derivative of the PES.

## example06

Binding energy of the water-water dimer with the JAGP anstaz.

## example07

Weak scalings of VMC and LRDMC using the water molecule.

## example08

How to call modules of `jQMC` from a `python` script.
