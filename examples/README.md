# Examples
A collection of examples of jQMC codes.

## example01
Total energy and atomic forces of water molecule. One can learn how to obtain the VMC and DMC (in the extrapolated limit) energies and VMC forces of the Water dimer, starting from scratch (i.e., DFT calculation)

## example02
VMC and HF energies of water molecule, for validation of the VMC implementation of jQMC.

## example03
Binding Water-Methane dimer, one of the validation tests for ab initio DMC implementation. 

## example04
Benchmarking of MPI/Vectorization on CPU and GPU machines, i.e., how to choose the most efficient number of walkers and number of MPI processes.
