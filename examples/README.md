# Examples

A collection of examples of jQMC codes.

## example01

Total energy of water molecule. One can learn how to obtain the VMC and DMC (in the extrapolated limit) energies of the Water dimer, starting from scratch (i.e., DFT calculation), with cartesian GTOs.

## example02

Benchmarking of MPI/Vectorization on CPU and GPU machines, i.e., how to choose the most efficient number of walkers and number of MPI processes, with spherical GTOs.

## example03

Binding Water-Methane dimer, one of the validation tests for ab initio DMC implementation

## example04

VMC and HF energies of water molecule, for validation of the VMC implementation of jQMC, with spherical or cartesian GTOs.
