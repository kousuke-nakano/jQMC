Total energy of water molecule. One can learn how to obtain the VMC and DMC (in the extrapolated limit) energies of the Water dimer, starting from scratch (i.e., DFT calculation), with cartesian GTOs.

## Generate a trial WF

The first step of ab-initio QMC is to generate a trial WF by a mean-field theory such as DFT/HF. `jQMC` interfaces with other DFT/HF software packages via `TREXIO`.

One of the easiest ways to produce it is using `pySCF` as a converter to the `TREXIO` format is implemented.
