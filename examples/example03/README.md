# Binding energy of water-methane dimer
One of the validation tests for ab initio DMC implementation. See the [paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.12950).

![LRDMC validation](jqmc_validation_water_methane.jpg)

Reproduced water and methane LRDMC energies. So. the LRDMC implementations in `jqmc` should be correct. Water-Methane calculations are WIP.
